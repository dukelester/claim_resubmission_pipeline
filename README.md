# Claim Resubmission Ingestion Pipeline

This project implements **Case Study 1** from the Humaein AI Full Stack Developer screening challenge.  
It is a data engineering pipeline that ingests healthcare claim data from multiple EMR systems, normalizes the schema, and applies business rules to identify claims eligible for **automated resubmission**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Ingests **CSV** (Alpha source) and **JSON** (Beta source) claims data.
- Normalizes all records into a **unified schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "claim_id": "string",
    "patient_id": "string or null",
    "procedure_code": "string",
    "denial_reason": "string or null",
    "status": "approved/denied",
    "submitted_at": "ISO date",
    "source_system": "alpha or beta"
  }


### Applies eligibility rules for resubmission:

    - Claim status = denied

    - Patient ID is not null

    - Claim submitted more than 7 days ago (relative to 2025-07-30)

    - Denial reason is retryable (or mapped from ambiguous reasons)

### Outputs results into:

    - resubmission_candidates.json => eligible claims

    - rejected_records.json => invalid/non-retryable claims

#### Includes basic logging (pipeline metrics + errors).

## Setup & Installation

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/dukelester/claim_resubmission_pipeline.git

cd claim_resubmission_pipeline
```


### Create and activate a virtual environment:

```python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
OR venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```


### Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Pipeline

`python main.py`

### This will:

    * Load data from data/emr_alpha.csv and data/emr_beta.json.

    * Normalize and process all records.

    * Save results into:

    resubmission_candidates.json

    rejected_records.json

    * Log execution summary into logs/pipeline.log.
